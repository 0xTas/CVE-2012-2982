**This PoC exploit for CVE-2012-2982 was written as an exercise for the "Intro to PoC scripting" Room on TryHackMe**. <br>

The room can be found here: https://tryhackme.com/room/intropocscripting <br>

I was originally going to use Python to follow along, but decided to practice my Rust skills instead.<br><br>

I also saw that nearly every single non-metasploit implementation on Github was in Python, 
so I figured that bringing something new to the table might be fun.

```bash
# To get detailed info about arguments:
cargo run -- --help

# General command structure:
cargo run -- <rhost> <lhost> <username> <password> [rport] [lport] [auto-listen] [payload]
```
<br>

**From Binary:**<br>
```bash
# To get detailed info about arguments:
./cve-2012-2982 --help

# General command structure:
